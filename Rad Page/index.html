            <p>I have no idea what I should put on a pet page these days. I used to love making pet pages for all of my pets when I was a kid, but alas my original account, and thus my amazing websites that I lovingly crafted for my pets got purged. I wish I could see them, I bet they're hysterically terrible. The main problem is like, I don't remember what my email was at the time because I made new email addresses every six months at that point in my life, and no idea what my username was. I had a Silver Lupe, I remember that. Only because Lupe Day is my birthday and I absolutely lost it when I was able to afford the silver paintbrush. I was literally on the floor crying. My Mother also unfortunately remembers this. Now I have like 20 paintbrushes in my sbd? What a flex. Dang I'm cool now.</p>

            <div class="second"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/PN8gZRF8/gothclub.png"height="200px"display="inline"><p>Okay so here is who Irdu_Lili is as a pet. He only goes to the hottest clubs, and dances really really hard. He's a little goth man. Here's a picture of him hanging out at a club. Wow! What a cool dude. He's a Wraith Shoyru. You can't say a bad word about my little man. I don't care he's a Wraith he's a gentleman. I like to think his favorite food is bananas, but I only ever stuff the guy full of Omlette's because let's be real you might as well feed them with what you're getting for free? I should buy him some bananas. If this poor creature was really alive I would of abandoned him to his own devices for years at a time, leaving him to fend for himself. Then there would be periods where I was just overbearing him and keeping him busy in the battledome (He's my obligatory BD pet cause he looks tough!). It's terrible. I feel so bad for him. I'm so glad he isn't real otherwise he'd probably eat me alive for my transgressions. He's Level #LEVEL so he'd wreck me pretty bad. Hey wanna see something irrelevant? It's his speed of #SPEED. I don't level it because it's a waste of codestones but that's a factoid you've seen with your own eyes. There you go. So, he was the first pet I made on this account, I was orringally gonna make a Lupe, but then like, I don't know I just was feeling making a little dragon guy. Shoyru's are the best dragon pet, don't come at me with a nebbish looking Drake. Drakes are okay but I'd rather hug a Shoyru than a Drake if you know what I mean. They're rounder, cuter, and in the old art no one knew how many eyes they had. Just because of how they were posed. </p>

I think Neopets is literally as fast as it was in 2001. I remember spending hours on this website, getting kicked off when my mom had to use the phone. I remember I thought to myself "Imagine what this website will be like in 25 years." What should I tell that bright eyed child? The site runs at about the same speed, given now I'm paying 70 dollars a month for internet that is supposed to run at 500mbps, actually runs at 350mbps. Yet I'm waiting for pages to load like I'm rocking 56kbps. DO Y'ALL REMEBER THESE CUPS? It's just really crazy how times have changed. This wouldn't be a remotely acceptable website these days but I just have a fondness for Y2k era jank. It's giving, an inflatable couch, a telephone shaped like a pair of lips, and a lamp with pink fur on the shade. Reading Animporh's newest book and man I didn't even have to pay rent back then I could just chill. Stuff is so different now. I remember being sad sometimes because my only real friends were on the internet over AIM and I couldn't talk to them when I was away from the computer. It was lonely. Now I can talk to anyone I want, whenever I want. I could of made this website on a phone if I was feeling squirrely enough (I wasn't.) Though they should bring back the changeable face plates that were like, airbrushed with dolphins. I don't feel the same way about dolphins as I did when I was a kid though. When I was a kid I loved them. Now I know better. </p>

            <p>Do you remeber when Adam Powell tried to crypto-bro scam the Neopets community? Man. That was wild. Just the last few years in general on neopets has been wild. I don't have any real life friends I can talk to Neopets about because I'm an adult, and like they're cool with me talking about it but they don't like get how weird it is for someone you thought was super cool when you were twelve to try and crypto scam you and then make a rude gesture at the community on discord. I took it personally a little. I thought he and Donna were just the coolest people on earth when I was a kid. They built a whole website? WOW. And he is getting his hope, I'm unfortunately in poverty. Sad face! I got in my alternate universe mobility scooter and found a version of him that's less disappointing. I think it's just really interesting to like, look back on our expectations and stuff as children and come and look at this site as adults, for those of us who have been on this site entirely too long. I don't want to like, sound like I'm complaining though. The last year on this site has been so amazing. Like, better than it's been since I remade my account in 2011. Sure the site is still user hostile with how it's laid out (mostly the switch between the old and new format trips me up.) but the advent calendar? A PEBBLE P3? Pure genius. Things have changed so much for the good. I'm proud of you neopets team. Even in the universe where Adam Powell isn't a loser now. </p>
